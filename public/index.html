      Pleiades is a tool that helps Vega-Lite users with less experience in JSON to easily compose complicated multiple Vega-Lite views.
      For example, concat view can contains repeat view that also contains concat of layer views; composing this visualization using
      JSON can be verbose and hard to visualize since it requires multiple levels of nested view-compositions. Pleiades is a graphical
      composing tool for Vega-Lite views. Users can easily compose views using concat, layer, repeat, and facet. It also provides suggestions
      to users to prevent them from composing not-fully-compatible views. In the end, the users can export the composed view into Vega-Lite
      JSON specification, to render normally with Vega-Lite compiler.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><em>
      Since Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar, the grammar is easy to understand, so the range of users using the software can
      be from computer science expert to coding beginner. Although users with less JSON experience can work with most
      of the Vega-Lite easily, View Composition requires a good understanding of tree structure since View Composition can be
      nested inside each other to create complex views. Beginner users can struggle using this feature.
    </em></p>
    <p><em>
      This software provides a graphical user interface for users to compose Vega-Lite charts. The users can add charts that
      they want to work with to the software, then they can compose them with layer, concat, repeat, and facet. They can also
      compose composed chart with one of the four technique. The software also provide warnings when the users are trying to
      compose charts that are incompatible with each other to avoid unexpected behaviors.

    <h2>Running Instructions</h2>
    <em>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To add Vega-Lite spec to the application to work with, you can click 'NEW SPEC'. Then, type or paste Vega-Lite spec into the editor.
          Or, you can click examples to try adding example Vega-Lite specs. You can also set alias to each spec in the upper-left text box.
          Then, click 'SAVE'.
        </li>
        <li>
          To add the first Vege-Lite spec to the main view, you can click the spec; then click 'PLACE' in the operation bar (bar on the top).
        </li>
        <li>
          To layer views, click a view in the main view, and a view in the side bar. Then, click 'LAYER'. A menu will shows up, and you can choose whether you
          want the view in the side bar to be layered under or over the view in the main view.
        </li>
        <li>
          To concat views, click a view in the main view, and a view in the side bar. Then, click 'CONCAT'. A menu will shows up, and you can choose the direction you
          want the view in the side bar to be concatinated to the view in the main view.
        </li>
        <li>
          To repeat a view, click a view in the main view. Then, click 'REPEAT'. A window will pops up, and you can choose to repeat row or column by
          checking and filling array of field names and their encoding channels. Then click 'Repeat'.
        </li>
        <li>
          To facet a view, click a view in the main view. Then, click 'FACET'. A window will pops up, and you can choose to facet row or column by
          checking and filling their field names and types. Then click 'Facet'.
        </li>
        <li>
          To edit each spec in the main view, click the view you would like to edit, then click 'EDIT'.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can select inner view of Repeat and Facet by enabling 'Inner View Navigator'. When click at a view in the main view, the inner view of the selected view is displayed in the Inner View Navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can always undo and redo every interaction by clicking 'UNDO' and 'REDO' buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          When finished composing views, you can click 'EXPORT' to download the resulting Vega-Lite spec.
        </li>
      </ol>
